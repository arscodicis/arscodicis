### Hi, I'm Ars_Codicis! That name is in Latin, and a rough translation is "Code is an Art." 😎

- 🔭 My current work is on educational software for kids, with a focus on private-school curriculums. I've written a couple apps for both the Google Play Store, and the App Store. You can check them out at my website: https://www.piruxgames.com. Also working on a large-scale JSON regulation and verification tool with C++.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to scale large projects and write less duplicitous code. I'm also teaching myself `Kotlin` for future Android development.
  
- 🚀 I love learning new technologies, as well as old. Over the years, I've taught myself `MASM` for fun. I've also learned `C`. I put those two together, and built a x86 OS from scratch, and booted it! Nowadays, I'm trying to teach myself Machine Learning with Python, just to stay on the cutting edge. 😉
  
- ⚙️ Development tools/languages I have experience with: `Python`, `Java`, `C/C++`, `Kotlin`, `Swift`, `Dart` (`Flutter`), `C#`, `VB.NET`, and `Javascript`. I've developed native apps for both `iOS` and `Android` systems. Lately, I've picked up Flutter for cross platform development. I also build tools to help me with development for both Windows and macOS. For Windows, I use Visual Studio, macOS I use Xcode. I have experience with VS Code, Android Studio, and quite a few IDEs in the IntelliJ family. I'm looking forward to learning new ones too!
